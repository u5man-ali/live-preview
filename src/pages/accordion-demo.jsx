            Yes, DezineCrafts is built with React and Tailwind CSS in mind. Each component is provided as a JSX snippet and can be seamlessly integrated into any React project. The utility-first CSS approach also makes it easy to adapt the UI kit to Vue, Next.js, or even plain HTML with Tailwind.

            Absolutely! Every component in the UI kit is designed with customization in mind. You can adjust styles using Tailwind classes, swap icons, change variants (like primary, neutral, etc.), and override props to match your branding and layout requirements.

            Yes, the components follow accessible design patterns and are keyboard-friendly by default. While dark mode support is not fully styled out-of-the-box, the kit is structured to make toggling themes with Tailwind’s dark: variants simple and scalable.
